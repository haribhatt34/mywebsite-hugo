# Biography

I am a junior postdoctoral fellow in the [Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Subsites/Experimental-cardiology) at the University Medical Center Utrecht and University of Utrecht. My research interest is in the genetic and epigenetic causes of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis underlying ischemic stroke (IS) and coronary artery disease (CAD).

I am currently working on integrating Bayesian fine-mapping methodology, expression and methylation quantitative trait loci analyses in circulating cells and atherosclerotic tissues, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plaque and serum biomarkers as well as plaque characteristics based on high-through imaging of histological slides. As means of integrating these biological layers I apply Mendelian Randomisation methods to infer causal genes, proteins, networks and biomarkers underlying IS and CAD.

I actively contributed to the [International Stroke Genetics Consortium](http://www.strokegenetics.org). In addition, I made some contributions to international consortia, including [GENIUS-CHD](http://www.genius-chd.com), [GIANT](http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium), [GLGC](http://lipidgenetics.org), [GoDMC](http://www.godmc.org.uk), and various other international consortia.
