# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Subsites/UMC-Utrecht-Lab/About-us/Laboratory-of-Clinical-Chemistry-Haematology) which is part of the [Circulatory Health Program](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Research/Strategic-themes/Circulatory-Health) at the University Medical Center Utrecht and University of Utrecht and work with [professor dr. Folkert W. Asselbergs](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Research/Strategic-themes/Circulatory-Health/Research-themes/Group-Asselbergs) and [professor dr. Gerard Pasterkamp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-pasterkamp-71a1b36/). My research interest is focused on the genetic and epigenetic causes of atherosclerosis underlying _ischemic stroke_ subtypes, _coronary artery disease_ (CAD) and _abdominal aortic aneurysm_ (AAA), and intermediate traits such as _carotid intima media thickness_ (cIMT) and arterial calcification.

I am currently working on integrating Bayesian fine-mapping methodology, expression and methylation quantitative trait loci analyses in circulating cells and atherosclerotic tissues, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plaque and serum biomarkers as well as plaque characteristics based on high-through imaging of histological slides. As means of integrating these biological layers I apply Mendelian Randomisation methods to infer causal genes, proteins, networks and biomarkers underlying stroke and CAD. The ultimate aim of my work is to identify new therapeutic targets for CAD and stroke. 

I actively contribute to the [International Stroke Genetics Consortium](http://www.strokegenetics.org). In addition, I make contributions to international consortia, including [GENIUS-CHD](http://www.genius-chd.com), [GIANT](http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium), [GLGC](http://lipidgenetics.org), [GoDMC](http://www.godmc.org.uk), 1Million Hearts, and various other international consortia. 

This work is covered through various (inter)national collaborative grant programs: CVON-GENIUS2 funded by the Dutch Heart Foundation (DHF, grant-number: CVON 2017-20), ERA-CVD 'druggable-MI-targets' in part funded by the DHF (grant-number: JTC2017-40-2017T096), and Leducq Fondation [Plaq_Omics_](https://www.plaqomics.com/).
