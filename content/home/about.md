# Biography

I am a junior postdoctoral fellow in the [Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Subsites/Experimental-cardiology) at the University Medical Center Utrecht and University of Utrecht. My research interest is in the genetics of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis.

I am currently working on fine-mapping and functional genomics of cardiovascular risk loci, quantitative trait loci analyses in circulating cells and atherosclerotic tissues, high-through imaging of histological slides, genome-wide association studies of putative biomarkers, epigenetic analyses of cardiovascular disease, and causal inference by means of Mendelian randomisation.

I actively contributed to the [International Stroke Genetics Consortium](http://www.strokegenetics.org). In addition, I made some contributions to international consortia, including [GENIUS-CHD](http://www.genius-chd.com), [GIANT](http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium), [GLGC](http://lipidgenetics.org), [GoDMC](http://www.godmc.org.uk), and various other international consortia.
