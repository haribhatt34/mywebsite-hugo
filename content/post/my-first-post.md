Today marks the day of re-inventing my academic self. As the genetics community ushers in what some refer to as the post-GWAS era, I feel things are falling to place for me. In the last couple of weeks, I've been reading a lot and formulating my plans for the next 3-5 years. My key-interests will involve:

* Functional cardiovascular genomics, including quantitative trait loci analyses using expression, protein and methylation datasets;
* Cardiovascular genetics, including rare and common variant analyses, loss-of-function analyses;
* Causal inference using *[Mendelian randomisation](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/68/9/934)*;
* High-throughput imaging and analysis through machine-learning.

Likely this will be my first of very few posts, I feel the publications, my GitHub-repositories, and other activities should speak for themselves.
